# Psychic-Game

This is a guessing game between the user and the computer.

The computer randomly chooses a letter.
The user gets 10 attempts to guess the letter.
If the user guesses the letter, the wins increase by 1.
If the user guesses an incorrect letter, the number of gusses decreases until all 10 attempts are used, which will the reset the game.
The user's guesses will appear on the screen, the computer guess will not.
